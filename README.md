# Tuition Reimbursement Management System
The Tuition Reimbursement Management System (TRMS) is a web application that manages the process of reimbursing employees for education-related expenses incurred while working for a company. 

Using the TRMS, all employees can:

- log in to their employee account
- read information regarding how the TRMS works
- create new requests for tuition reimbursement
- view past and pending reimbursement requests 
 
Supervisors, Department Heads, and Benefits Coordinators can:
- log in to their employee account
- create and view their own requests
- approve or deny their subordinates' requests

Benefits Coordinators can also edit the amount of reimbursement that will be offered for a specific reimbursement request. Requests created for events that are less than 2 weeks away from occuring will be marked as "urgent" when viewed by a Supervisor, Department Head, or Benefits Coordinator.
